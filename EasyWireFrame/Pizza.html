  <h1>Pizza</h1>

  <p>The Pizza Party is usually a nightmare for the parents who have kids on sports teams to start with but the kids love it.
  We have always tried to do away with it but whenever it is fall we have kids and parents asking us when the party is and they ask us what the menu looks like. Is it just pizza or will there be pasta and dessert as well? The answer is yes, yes and yes!
  In the event of rain we always have it indoors and it is a challenge for the host parents but it is a tradition that we would like to keep.</p>

  <p>The world's largest pizza was delivered on May 16, at the roundtable of the wizards in their conference room. It is the most inarticulate pizza ever made and it means that it also did not taste very good.  It was in 1856 that an Italian came into NYC and made the first pizza. It is largely a secret what he made but the Lombardi's are where he slept and died.</p>
